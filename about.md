# what is snej.de?
It's a domain which I use for my personal purposes. E.g. to run this home page.

# who are you?
Hello, World! I'm Jens Wirth. I live near Hanover in Germany. Interestingly, I have only one frontal sinus. I neither know why that is nor why I'm writing this here. The main thing is that you always know where your towel is. So, don't panic!

# how to contact you?
- mail: [jw@snej.de](mailto:jw@snej.de).
- If you are a radio amateur: My call is DL7JEW. The QTH is JO42sj. I'm interested in worldwide QRP communication on HF using digimodes like WSPR, JT65 and of course the new FT8 mode.
- Also, I do have a postal address:<br />
Jens Wirth<br />
Friesenstr. 10<br />
30926 Seelze (OT GÃ¼mmer)<br />
Germany
