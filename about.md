# what is snej.de?
It's a domain which I use for my personal purposes. E.g. to run this home page.

# who are you?
Hello, World! I'm Jens Wirth. I live near Hanover in Germany with my daughter, wife and two cats. Interestingly, I have only one frontal sinus. I neither know why that is nor why I'm writing this here. The main thing is that you always know where your towel is. So don't panic. 

# how to contact you?
