I recently bought a Dell XPS 15 9570 (2018). These are my notes for setting up a dual boot system allowing me to run my favorite GNU/Linux distribution - Linux Mint - and the pre-installed Windows 10 operating system.

# Collecting some important stuff to know

## Hardware
- I bought the variant with i7-8750H CPU, 16 GB of RAM and 512 GB of SDD
- The SDD is a M.2 2280 PCIe Solid State Drive

## Boot related settings in nowadays BIOS:
- UEFI: Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
- Legacy Mode: booting non UEFI supported operating systems
- SecureBoot: A protocol defined since UEFI 2.3.1 Errata C specification
- IDE / AHCI / Raid


# How to boot Linux from an USB drive?
- Enable Legacy Mode to be able to boot Linux from an USB drive
- Once you booted your Linux USB drive, you will notice that your internal SDD is not visible (check fdisk -l)
- Enable AHCI in the Bios to make Linux see your internal SDD (check fdisk -l)
- With AHCI is enabled, the preinstalled Windows 10 won't boot :-(
- *TODO: How to install AHCI drivers in Windows 10 to make them available when Windows boots*
