Just out of curiosity, I tried to create a VGA signal with the [Xilinx Spartan-3E Starter Kit](http://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/HW-SPAR3E-SK-US-G.htm). It all ended up as a Pong game with some funny behavior. Feel free to [download the project files](http://snej.de/downloads/SpartanPong.rar) (created with Xilinx ISE WebPack 12.1) or just watch the video. The project runs at 640x480@60Hz. I learned about the VGA signal timing from [here](http://www.epanorama.net/documents/pc/vga_timing.html) and of course by playing around a lot ;o)
