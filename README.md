Hello, World! This is the source code of my personal homepage.

# TODO

Stuff I'm planning to add next:
- ~~Hall of Syntax~~
- generic FSM implementation (own, Boost, ...)
- eRubberduck / random review questions
- interesting LT Spice simulations / configuration for better FFT results
- gnuradio-companion (AM/FM receiver, ADS-B, protocol decoder, integrate wireshark?)
- Building a portable HB9CV-antenna for 2m (or duoband?)
- interesting Q&A (like Jens' coffee & spoon phenomenom)
- creating images from binary data
- Add Limesdr page
