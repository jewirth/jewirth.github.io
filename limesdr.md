# what is LimeSDR?
LimeSDR is a fully open source [software defined radio (SDR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio) board created by [Lime Microsystems](http://www.limemicro.com/) and funded via [Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/lime-micro/limesdr) in June 2016.

# intention of this page
When I received my LimeSDR, I got very confused by the documentation available one the net. There seemed to be no source that provided a good, structured documentation about the usage of the LimeSDR board. It was more like all the information necessary to operate the LimeSDR in a very basic use case was spread on the net and I found it difficult to figure out what kind of information I really need.
